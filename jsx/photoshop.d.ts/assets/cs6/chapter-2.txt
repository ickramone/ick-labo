ActionDescriptor
This object provides a dictionary-style mechanism for storing data as key-value pairs. It can be used for
low-level access into Photoshop. See an example of this usage in ‘Selection sample script’ on page 168.
Many configuration files use serialized action descriptors to represent their data. It is used, for example, to
encapsulate playback options in Application.playbackParameters, and is returned by
Application.getCustomOptions().

ActionList
This object provides an array-style mechanism for storing data. It can be used for low-level access into
Photoshop.
This object is ideal when storing data of the same type. All items in the list must be of the same type.
You can use the "put" methods, such as putBoolean(), to append new elements, and can clear the entire
list using clear(), but cannot otherwise modify the list.
Note: The ActionList object is part of the Action Manager functionality. For details on using the Action
Manager, see the Photoshop CS6 Scripting Guide.
Properties
Methods
With the exception of the clear() method, you use the methods of this object to either get the value of a
specific type of data in the list or set (put) the value type.

Application
The Adobe Adobe Photoshop CS6 application object, which is the root of the object model and provides
access to all other objects. This object provides application-wide information, such as application defaults
and available fonts. It provides many important methods , such as those for opening files and loading
documents.
To access the properties and methods, you can use the pre-defined global variable app. For example:
var docRef = app.documents.add(800, 600, 72, "docRef", NewDocumentMode.RGB);
The properties and methods of the Application object are also available at the top level; you can omit
references to the Application object altogether. For example:
var docRef = documents.add(800, 600, 72, "docRef", NewDocumentMode.RGB);
This usage can be somewhat ambiguous; for clarity, it is recommended that you use an explicit reference
to app.

A channel is analogous to a plate in the printing process that applies a single color. The document’s color
mode determines the number of default channels; for example, an RGB document has three channels, red,
green, and blue. A color can also have an alpha channel, which stores selections as masks, or a spot
channel, which stores spot colors.

PathPoint
Represents the anchor and control-handle endpoints for a path segment. Each point (the anchor point,

segments. The properties are read-only. Access PathPoint objects through the SubPathItem.pathPoints
property.
● Use PathPointInfo with PathItems.add() to create path points. The properties are writeable.
For paths that are straight segments (not curved), the coordinates of all three points are the same. For
curved segements, the the coordinates are different. The difference between the anchor point and the left
or right direction points determines the arc of the curve. You use the left direction point to bend the curve
"outward" or make it convex; you use the right direction point to bend the curve "inward" or make it
concave.

SubPathInfo.entireSubPath property before using that object to create a path item with
PathItems.add().
See the PathPointInfo sample script below.
● The resulting SubPathItem objects contain the resulting PathPoint objects. Use the PathPoint object to

dialog (Select Justification on the Paragraphs
palette menu).
Valid only when justification =
Justification.CENTERJUSTIFIED,

Tip: When true for many consecutive characters, can
prevent word wrap and thus may prevent some
text from appearing on the screen.

position array of
UnitValue
Read-write. The position of origin for the text. The
array members specify the X and Y coordinates.

points
Read-write. The amount of space to indent text from
the right.

[-1296..1296]
points
Read-write. The amount of space to use before each

tracking number
[-1000..10000]
Read-write. The amount of uniform spacing between
multiple characters.
Tracking units are 1/1000 of an em space. The width
of an em space is relative to the current type size. In a
1-point font, 1 em equals 1 point; in a 10-point font, 1
em equals 10 points. So, for example, 100 units in a
10-point font are equivalent to 1 point.
